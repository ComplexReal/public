## The Between

A hundred years ago, Bauhaus alchemized the relationship between machines and humans. Melding disciplines, it recentered the value of human labor and discernment in an age of automation and set the agenda for the twentieth century. Powerful and durable as it was, we've outgrown that vision. It's time to revisit the relationship between humans and machines, to surface the questions, ideas, protocols and products that meet our moment. _The Between_ lays the foundation for such a new vision, igniting exchanges across disciplines that, like Bauhaus, aim to soften and integrate seemingly rigid binariesâ€”starting with code vs craft. We are forming an association of forward-looking practitioners, embedded in community, to unshackle research, stimulate industry, and create the sort of knowledge that modern society and the modern economy so desperately need and want.
